      <t>This document discusses multi-homing considerations for
      Distributed-Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS). The goal is
      to provide some guidance for DOTS clients/gateways when multihomed.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In many deployments, it may not be possible for a network to
      determine the cause of a distributed Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack
      <xref target="RFC4732"></xref>. Rather, the network may just realize
      that some resources appear to be under attack. To help with such
      situations, the IETF has specified the DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS)
      architecture <xref target="RFC8811"></xref>, where a DOTS client can
      inform an upstream DOTS server that its network is under a potential
      attack and that appropriate mitigation actions are required. The DOTS
      protocols can be used to coordinate real-time mitigation efforts which
      can evolve as the attacks mutate, thereby reducing the impact of an
      attack and leading to more efficient responsive actions. <xref
      target="RFC8903"></xref> identifies a set of scenarios for DOTS; most of
      these scenarios involve a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).</t>

      <t>The high-level base DOTS architecture is illustrated in <xref
      target="arch"></xref> (<xref target="RFC8811"></xref>):</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8811"></xref> specifies that the DOTS client may be
      provided with a list of DOTS servers; each of these servers is
      associated with one or more IP addresses. These addresses may or may not
      be of the same address family. The DOTS client establishes one or more
      DOTS sessions by connecting to the provided DOTS server(s) addresses
      (e.g., by using <xref target="RFC8973"></xref>).</t>

      <t>DOTS may be deployed within networks that are connected to one single
      upstream provider. DOTS can also be enabled within networks that are
      multi-homed. The reader may refer to <xref target="RFC3582"></xref> for
      an overview of multi-homing goals and motivations. This document
      discusses DOTS multi-homing considerations. Specifically, the document
      aims to:<list style="numbers">
          <t>Complete the base DOTS architecture with multi-homing specifics.
          Those specifics need to be taken into account because: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Sending a DOTS mitigation request to an arbitrary DOTS server
              will not necessarily help in mitigating a DDoS attack.</t>

              <t>Blindly forking all DOTS mitigation requests among all
              available DOTS servers is suboptimal.</t>

              <t>Sequentially contacting DOTS servers may increase the delay
              before a mitigation plan is enforced.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Identify DOTS deployment schemes in a multi-homing context, where
          DOTS services can be offered by all or a subset of upstream
          providers.</t>

          <t>Provide guidelines and recommendations for placing DOTS requests
          in multi-homed networks, e.g.,: <list style="symbols">
              <t>Select the appropriate DOTS server(s).</t>

              <t>Identify cases where anycast is not recommended for DOTS.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This document adopts the following methodology: <list style="symbols">

    </section>

    <section anchor="msc" title="Multi-Homing Scenarios">
      <t>This section describes some multi-homing scenarios that are relevant
      to DOTS. In the following subsections, only the connections of border
      routers are shown; internal network topologies are not elaborated.</t>

      <t>A multihomed network may enable DOTS for all or a subset of its
      upstream interconnection links. In such a case, DOTS servers can be
      explicitly configured or dynamically discovered by a DOTS client using
      means such as those discussed in <xref target="RFC8973"></xref>. These
      DOTS servers can be owned by the upstream provider, managed by a
      third-party (e.g., mitigation service provider), or a combination
      thereof.</t>

      <t>If a DOTS server is explicitly configured, it is assumed that an
      interface is also provided to bind the DOTS service to an
      interconnection link. If no interface is provided, this means that the
      DOTS server can be reached via any active interface.</t>

      <t>This section distinguishes between residential CPEs vs. enterprise
      CPEs because PI addresses may be used for enterprises while this is not
      the current practice for residential CPEs.</t>

      <t>In the following subsections, all or a subset of interconnection
      links are associated with DOTS servers.</t>

      <section anchor="sc1" title="Multi-Homed Residential Single CPE">
        <t>The scenario shown in <xref target="rcpe"></xref> is characterized
        as follows: <list style="symbols">
            <t>The home network is connected to the Internet using one single
            CPE.</t>

            <t>The CPE is connected to multiple provisioning domains (i.e.,
            both fixed and mobile networks). Provisioning domain (PvD) is
            explained in <xref target="RFC7556"></xref>. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />In a typical deployment scenario, these
            provisioning domains are owned by the same provider (see Section 1
            of <xref target="RFC8803"></xref>). Such a deployment is meant to
            seamlessly use both fixed and cellular networks for bonding,
            faster hand-overs, or better resiliency purposes.</t>

            <t>Each of these provisioning domains assigns IP
            addresses/prefixes to the CPE and provides additional
            configuration information such as a list of DNS servers, DNS
            suffixes associated with the network, default gateway address, and
            DOTS server's name <xref target="RFC8973"></xref>. These
            addresses/prefixes are assumed to be Provider-Aggregatable
            (PA).</t>

            <t>Because of ingress filtering, packets forwarded by the CPE
            towards a given provisioning domain must be sent with a source IP
            address that was assigned by that domain <xref
            target="RFC8043"></xref>.</t>

      <t>These deployment schemes are further discussed in the following
      subsections.</t>

      <section anchor="dcpe" title="Residential CPE">
        <t><xref target="dotsrcpe"></xref> depicts DOTS sessions that need to
        be established between a DOTS client (C) and two DOTS servers (S1, S2)
        within the context of the scenario described in <xref
        target="sc1"></xref>.</t>

        <t>For each provisioning domain, the DOTS client MUST resolve the DOTS
        server's name provided by a provisioning domain <xref
        target="RFC8973"></xref> using the DNS servers learned from the
        respective provisioning domain (or the DNS servers associated with the
        interface(s) for which a DOTS server was explicitly configured).
        IPv6-capable DOTS clients MUST use the source address selection
        algorithm defined in <xref target="RFC6724"></xref> to select the
        candidate source addresses to contact each of these DOTS servers. DOTS
        sessions MUST be established and MUST be maintained with each of the
        DOTS servers because the mitigation scope of each of these servers is
        restricted. The DOTS client SHOULD use the certificate provisioned by
        a provisioning domain to authenticate itself to the DOTS server(s)
        provided by the same provisioning domain.</t>

        <t>When conveying a mitigation request to protect the attack
        target(s), the DOTS client MUST select an available DOTS server whose
        network has assigned the IP prefixes from which target
        prefixes/addresses are derived. This implies that if no appropriate
        DOTS server is found, the DOTS client MUST NOT send the mitigation
        request to any other available DOTS server.</t>

        <t>For example, a mitigation request to protect target resources bound
        to a PA IP address/prefix cannot be satisfied by a provisioning domain
        other than the one that owns those addresses/prefixes. Consequently,
        if a CPE detects a DDoS attack that spreads over all its network
        attachments, it MUST contact all DOTS servers for mitigation
        purposes.</t>

        <t>The DOTS client MUST be able to associate a DOTS server with each
        provisioning domain. For example, if the DOTS client is provisioned
        with S1 using DHCP when attaching to a first network and with S2 using
        Protocol Configuration Option (PCO) <xref target="TS.24008"></xref>
        when attaching to a second network, the DOTS client must record the
        interface from which a DOTS server was provisioned. DOTS signaling
        session to a given DOTS server must be established using the interface
        from which the DOTS server was provisioned. If a DOTS server is
        explicitly configured, DOTS signaling with that server must be
        established via the interfaces that are indicated in the explicit
        configuration or via any active interface if no interface is
        configured.</t>

        associations that can be established with a DOTS gateway, which is
        enabled within the context of the scenario described in <xref

          </figure>When PA addresses/prefixes are in use, the same
        considerations discussed in <xref target="dcpe"></xref> need to be
        followed by the DOTS gateway to contact its DOTS server(s). The DOTS
        gateways can be reachable from DOTS clients by using an unicast
        address or an anycast address.</t>

        <t>Nevertheless, when PI addresses/prefixes are assigned, the DOTS
        gateway MUST send mitigation requests to all its DOTS servers.
        Otherwise, the attack traffic may still be delivered via the ISP which
        hasn&rsquo;t received the mitigation request.</t>

        <t>An alternate deployment model is depicted in <xref
        target="mcms"></xref>. This deployment assumes that:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>One or more DOTS clients are enabled in hosts located in the
            internal network. These DOTS clients may use <xref
            target="RFC8973"></xref> to discover their DOTS server(s).</t>

            <t>These DOTS clients communicate directly with upstream DOTS
            servers.</t>

        <t>If PI addresses/prefixes are in use, the DOTS client MUST send a
        mitigation request to all the DOTS servers. The use of anycast
        addresses to reach the DOTS servers is NOT RECOMMENDED. If anycast
        addresses are used to reach multiple DOTS servers, the CPE may not be
        able to select the appropriate provisioning domain to which the
        mitigation request should be forwarded. As a consequence, the request
        may not be forwarded to the appropriate DOTS server.</t>

        <t>If PA addresses/prefixes are used, the same considerations
        discussed in <xref target="dcpe"></xref> need to be followed by the
        DOTS clients. Because DOTS clients are not embedded in the CPE and
        multiple addreses/prefixes may not be assigned to the DOTS client
        (typically in an IPv4 context), some issues may arise in how to steer
        traffic towards the appropriate DOTS server by using the appropriate
        source IP address. These complications discussed in <xref
        target="RFC4116"></xref> are not specific to DOTS.</t>

        <t>Another deployment approach is to enable many DOTS clients; each of
        them is responsible for handling communications with a specific DOTS
        server (see <xref target="scms"></xref>).</t>

        <t>For both deployments depicted in Figures <xref format="counter"
        target="mcms"></xref> and <xref format="counter"
        target="scms"></xref>, each DOTS client SHOULD be provided with
        policies (e.g., a prefix filter that will be against DDoS detection
        alarms) that will trigger DOTS communications with the DOTS servers.
        Such policies will help the DOTS client to select the appropriate
        destination DOTS server.</t>

        <t>The CPE MUST select the appropriate source IP address when
        forwarding DOTS messages received from an internal DOTS client.</t>

        also apply to the scenario described in <xref target="sc3"></xref>.
        One specific problem for this scenario is to select the appropriate
        exit router when contacting a given DOTS server.</t>

        <t>When PI addresses/prefixes are used, DOTS clients MUST contact all
        the DOTS gateways to send a DOTS message. DOTS gateways will then
        relay the request to the DOTS servers. Note that anycast addresses
        cannot be used to establish DOTS sessions between DOTS clients and
        DOTS gateways because only one DOTS gateway will receive the
        mitigation request.</t>

        <t>When PA addresses/prefixes are used, but no filter rules are
        provided to DOTS clients, the latter MUST contact all DOTS gateways
        simultaneously to send a DOTS message. Upon receipt of a request by a
        DOTS gateway, it MUST check whether the request is to be forwarded
        upstream (if the target IP prefix is managed by the upstream server)
        or rejected.</t>

        <t>When PA addresses/prefixes are used, but specific filter rules are
        provided to DOTS clients using some means that are out of scope of
        this document, the clients MUST select the appropriate DOTS gateway to
        reach. The use of anycast addresses is NOT RECOMMENDED to reach DOTS
        gateways.</t>

      <section title="Multi-Homed Enterprise: Single ISP">
        <t>The key difference of the scenario described in <xref

        multi-homing is provided by the same ISP. Concretely, that ISP can

            <t>The same DOTS server for all network attachments.</t>

            <t>Distinct DOTS servers for each network attachment. These DOTS
            servers need to coordinate when a mitigation action is received
            from the enterprise network.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In both cases, DOTS agents enabled within the enterprise network

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>DOTS-related security considerations are discussed in Section 4 of
      <xref target="RFC8811"></xref>.</t>

      <t>DOTS clients should control the information that they share with peer
      DOTS servers. In particular, if a DOTS client maintains DOTS sessions
      with specific DOTS servers per interconnection link, the DOTS client
      SHOULD NOT leak information specific to a given link to DOTS servers on
      different interconnection links that are not authorized to mitigate
      attacks for that given link. Whether this constraint is relaxed is
      deployment-specific and must be subject to explicit consent from the
      DOTS client domain administrator. How to seek for such consent is
      implementation- and deployment-specific.</t>
